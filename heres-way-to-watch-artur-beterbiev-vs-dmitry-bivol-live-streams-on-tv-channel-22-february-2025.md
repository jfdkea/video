We were all left craving more when the final bell rang at the end of the epic first encounter between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol in Saudi Arabia last October. Thankfully, we haven’t had to wait too long to see two of the most incredible light heavyweights of this generation reignite their rivalry. 

Beterbiev vs Bivol 2 takes place on Saturday, February 22, at the same venue as the first encounter - the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh. All four major light heavyweight world title belts are back on the line, and we are salivating at the prospect already.

Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol headline a seven-fight DAZN pay-per-view card from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for Beterbiev’s undisputed light heavyweight championship.

The show will feature two more title fights and four (!) interim title fights.

Patrick Stumberg will be on the round-by-round for today’s fights, and we’ll have full updates, highlights, results, and more in the stream below:

Beterbiev handed Bivol his lone loss in Oct. 2024 via majority decision, leaving several combat sports fans feeling that the decision should have gone the other way. Regardless, Bivol now has the chance to make things right for himself by winning back his titles in one of the most-anticipated rematches in recent memory.

And there’s another big prize waiting around the corner for the victor. Indeed, the Beterbiev vs. Bivol winner he will likely face off against “The Mexican Monster” David Benavidez, who is undefeated (30-0) with 24 knockouts. He also holds WBA’s Regular Light Heavyweight belt.

First things first, Beterbiev and Bivol have a score to settle in Riyadh. That said, let’s dive in and take a look the particulars to compare each combatant’s height, weight and other important attributes ahead of their highly-anticipated showdown later today.

Daniel Dubois, illness permitting, is due to defend his IBF heavyweight title against Joseph Parker while Artur Beterbiev faces Dmitry Bivol in an undisputed light-heavyweight rematch as part of Riyadh Season; watch live on Sky Sports Box Office from 4pm on Saturday February 22
